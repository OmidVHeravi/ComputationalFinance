        "- Evaluating risk: Positive skewness indicates there is potential for extreme positive returns, while negative skewness indicates potential for large losses. Understanding the skewness helps assess the riskiness of an investment.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modeling asset prices: Many asset pricing models such as the CAPM assume normal distribution of returns. However, returns often have positive skewness. Adjusting for skewness can improve asset pricing models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Explaining anomalies: Skewness preferences can explain anomalies like the equity premium puzzle - stocks have higher average returns partly due to investors liking the positive skewness of stock returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Portfolio optimization: Investors may optimize portfolios to prefer positive skewness in order to increase chances of very high returns. This may lead to underweighting assets with negative skewness.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Understanding crashes: Crashes and severe market declines exhibit high negative skewness. Analyzing skewness can provide information about likelihood of crashes.\n",
